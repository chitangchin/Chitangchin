# **Hi. I'm Brandon**

I built my own computer when I was 6 years old with a few broken computers salvaging parts where needed. Since then, I have always tinker with hardware and grew my passion to code. I am currently working at Lighthouse as a Software Engineer where I am helping developers and companies monitor their **Kafka Clusters stability and efficiency**.
