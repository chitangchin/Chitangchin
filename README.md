This is written in typescript using react and electron

### JPI Simplified SMTP Email App C# Code Snippet

The Acquisiton software asked the end user of the SMTP server, port, and SSL settings. To simplify the application, we modularized and added intuitive steps for the user to follow. This is intended to be a code snippet example for JPI Korea to review. This app uses mimekit and is written in C#
