### JPI Tips Electron App

[Github Link](https://github.com/chitangchin/JPI-Tips-Window-App) 

**Tech Stack:** React/TypeScript/Electron/Jest

To compensate for the lack of control we have with our acquisition software error handling, we moved in the direction of implementing our own software that will run concurrently with the acquisition and provide the user with more intuitive instructions on certain errors. This is written in typescript using react and electron

### JPI Simplified SMTP Email App C# Code Snippet

**Tech Stack:** C#/.NET

[Github Link](https://github.com/chitangchin/Simplified-SMTP-Email-App) 

The acquisition software asked the end user about the SMTP server, port, and SSL settings. To simplify the application, we modularized and added intuitive steps for the user to follow. This is intended to be a code snippet example for JPI Korea to review. This app uses mimekit and is written in C#

### Interactive System Design

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript/Jest

[Github Link](https://github.com/chitangchin/InteractiveSystemDesign)

I want to focus on a more interactive JavaScript learning experience with System Design. To supplement reading the Grokking System Design Interview, I want to design the system visually using console commands, tests, and intuitive indicators of why A B, and C are implemented and what is it doing.

### Grind 91: Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript/Jest

[Github Link](https://github.com/chitangchin/Grind75Practice)

Brainless repetition is a waste of time and resources in my opinion.

So my approach with Grind 91 is to do the following:

- Identify real use cases
- Understand Algorithm and Data Structure Patterns

You will find within each problem solved is a <ins>Real World Case Scenario</ins> if applicable and the <ins>General Pattern</ins>
